## Project Title: Sales & Customer Analytics Dashboard (SQL-based)**
Objective:
Analyze a fictional food business database to extract insights on sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends using SQL queries.

I created a fictional database using MySQL in a MSSQL Workbench environment.

### To create the database with 

1.	Go to the left pane and right click on CREATE SCHEMA (database).
2.	Name it sql_sales.


### Creating the four tables

     
| Table Name | Column Name |
|--------------|-------------|
|1. customers|a. customer_id (PK)|
|            |b. name        |
|            |c. email       |
|            |d. city        |
|            |e. signup_date|
|2. products|a. product_id (PK)  |
|            |b. product_name |
|            |c. category     |
|            |d. price        |
| 3. orders|a.	order_id (PK)|
|            |b. customer_id|                              
|            |c. order_date |     
|            |e. total_amount|
|4. order_items|b.	order_item_id(PK) |
|          |order_id(FK)|
|          |product_id(FK)|
|          |quantity|
|          |price|



### Next is to add data to the table.
I used the export wizard window for me to upload data on my table. Iâ€™ll just make sure the values is correct like the data types and format especially the date format (yyyy-mm-dd).

### Step 2: Write Analytical SQL Queries

Here are some queries that will showcase your skills:

Customer Insights

1.	Find the top 10 customers by total spending.
